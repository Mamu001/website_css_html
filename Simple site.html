<h1>Home </h1>
<p>I have created a sample site using content from the Il Moran Website content. </p> 
<p>Hidden under ancient trees, deep in the forest, are just 10 tents. They line the winding banks of the Mara River. You&rsquo;ll be the personal guest of our manager, who&rsquo;ll look after all your needs.</p>
<p>The camp is situated along the banks of the Mara River, right in the heart of the Masai Mara Game Reserve, with the best game viewing right on your doorstep. Governors Il Moran Camp has been awarded a Silver Eco Rating by Eco Tourism Kenya for our environmental practices both in camp and with our neighbourng community.Â <br>
  <br>
</p>
 <h1>The Camp</h1><p>The camp for those who want that extra bit of luxury. We&rsquo;ve kept Governors&rsquo; IL Moran Camp small and intimate, with added touches that make this the top of the range safari. IL Moran is widely regarded as the premiere camp in the Masai Mara.</p>
